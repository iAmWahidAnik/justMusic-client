Admins have full access to the site and its features. They can perform actions such as deleting, reading, and writing content. Their role is to oversee the platform's operations and ensure everything runs smoothly.

Instructors are able to add their classes to the site for students to enroll in. Once an instructor adds a class, it goes through an approval process by the admins. After the admins review and approve the class, it becomes visible in the students' portal, where they can browse and select the available classes.

Students are the main users of the site. They have the ability to purchase classes offered by instructors. Students can make payments through the site and gain access to the desired classes upon successful payment. This allows them to enhance their knowledge and skills by enrolling in various courses.

Overall, the project enables a seamless flow for instructors to offer classes, admins to review and approve them, and students to purchase and access the approved classes. It provides a platform for knowledge sharing and learning in a controlled and structured environment.
